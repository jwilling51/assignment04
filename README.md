**Course:** PPOL 6803: Intro to Data Science

**Authors:** Sarah Krause and Johnny Willing

**Description:** This assignment presents four visuals created from data on US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Title 8 Inadmissibles for calendar year 2014. "Inadmissible" refers to an individual encountered at a port of entry who sought lawful admission into the United States but was determined to not meet the legal requirements for entry. The datset used includes individual-level data on date of attempted entry, country of origin, age, charge (why they were denied entry), disposition (their current status, e.g. that they were granted parole and allowed to enter, or that they were marked for expedited removal), and other variables related to demographics and immigration status. This dataset is publicly available from the [CBP website](https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/cbp-office-field-operations-statistics).
